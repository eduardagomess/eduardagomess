### Hi there 👋 I will tell you a little about myself

<!--
**eduardagomess/eduardagomess** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

🙋 My name is Eduarda and I'm an undergrad student of Information Systems at the Federal University Of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brasil.

🔎 I'm a researcher at the Distributed Systems Research Lab (LAPESD) at UFSC. Here's what I mainly work with:
- I help develop systems through the integration of cryptocurrencies for the "Economy of Things" field. 
- I also help develop systems for the integration of Health data through the usage of public blockchains.

🌱 Right now, I'm learning these tools: the Python language and Object-oriented Programming.
📫 You can reach me at: eduardaoliveiragomess@gmail.com
⚡ Fun fact: I know how to make origami.
💬 Languages I speak: Portuguese (native) and English(intermediary).
