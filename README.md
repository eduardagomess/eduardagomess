### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I will tell you a little about myself

ðŸ™‹ My name is Eduarda and I'm an undergrad student of Information Systems at the Federal University Of Santa Catarina (UFSC), Brasil.

ðŸ”Ž I'm a researcher at the Distributed Systems Research Lab (LAPESD) at UFSC. Here's what I mainly work with:
- I help develop systems through the integration of cryptocurrencies for the "Economy of Things" field. 
- I also help develop systems for the integration of Health data through the usage of public blockchains.

ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm learning these tools: the Python language and Object-oriented Programming.
ðŸ“« You can reach me at: eduardaoliveiragomess@gmail.com
âš¡ Fun fact: I know how to make origami.
ðŸ’¬ Languages I speak: Portuguese (native) and English(intermediary).
